# Game Rules
The game board consists of twelve "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of multiple different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over one hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

Each turn:

The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol and If it doesn't match with the card already opened then The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
If the cards match,the card stay flipped over.
If the card do not match, player select other card which is flipped face down.
The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
